# Official project releases
=====================

This repo is used to build a Docker container that serves the codeorigin site for jQuery and related projects. It is designed to deploy easily, and includes a "break glass in case of emergency" minimal config mode should codeorigin need to be redeployed urgently.

It also contains the files necessary to build and deploy releases.jquery.com on a separate host, which provides an index of the files on codeorigin.

## Build a local copy of codeorigin

### Default, no restrictions

To build a local container (defaults to "break glass" mode):

1. Install Docker
1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
1. Build the image: `docker build -t releases ./`
1. Run the container, exposing port 80: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp releases`
1. To exit the container, press `ctrl+c`

### Redirect non-origin pulls to CDN

To build a local container in deployment mode (redirecting any requests without the magic header that indicates an origin pull), build the container with the header value in an environment variable:

1. Install Docker
1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
1. Generate a random string for the environment variable: ``CDN_ACCESS_KEY=`openssl rand -hex 32` ``
1. Build the image: `docker build -t prod-releases --build-arg CDN_ACCESS_KEY=$CDN_ACCESS_KEY ./`
1. Run the container, exposing port 80: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp prod-releases`
1. To exit the container, press `ctrl+c`

Note that you will need to keep track of `$CDN_ACCESS_KEY` and add it to the headers sent for origin pulls. To test whether this is working correctly, you can use `curl`:

* This should always redirect to `code.jquery.com`: `curl -i localhost/jquery-3.1.1.js`
* This should always deliver a copy of the file (don't forget to set the environment variable in your current shell): `curl -i -H "x-cdn-access: ${CDN_ACCESS_KEY}" localhost/jquery-3.1.1.js`

### Add support for `purge.php`

To build a container with support for `purge.php`, set environment variables with the CDN's API key and account hash.

1. Install Docker
1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
1. Set environment variables for the CDN API key and account hash: `CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN=(jQuery secret API token) && CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH=(jQuery account hash)`
1. Build the image: `docker build -t purge-releases --build-arg CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN=$CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN --build-arg CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH=$CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH ./`
1. Run the container, exposing port 80: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp purge-releases`
1. To exit the container, press `ctrl+c`

### Production clone

To build a production clone, include the steps for both non-origin redirects and `purge.php`.

1. Install Docker
1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
1. Generate a random string for the environment variable: ``CDN_ACCESS_KEY=`openssl rand -hex 16` ``
1. Set environment variables for the CDN API key and account hash: `CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN=(jQuery secret API token) && CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH=(jQuery account hash)`
1. Build the image: `docker build -t purge-releases --build-arg CDN_ACCESS_KEY=$CDN_ACCESS_KEY --build-arg CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN=$CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN --build-arg CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH=$CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH ./`
1. Run the container, exposing port 80: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp purge-releases`
1. To exit the container, press `ctrl+c`

## Build the production site

To deploy, first generate the CDN access key and locate the CDN API token and account hashes. Next, you'll need to configure the container host to build from the Dockerfile in this repository, and use the CDN access key, CDN API token, and CDN account hash as build arguments. Finally, you'll configure the CDN to send both the Host header and the access key during origin pulls.

1. Generate the access key: ``CDN_ACCESS_KEY=`openssl rand -hex 16` ``
1. Configure the container host to build from this repo, and set these build variable:
  * `CDN_ACCESS_KEY=(Insert the value of $CDN_ACCESS_KEY here)`
  * `CDN_PURGE_API_TOKEN=(Insert the value of the API token here)`
  * `CDN_PURGE_ACCOUNT_HASH=(Insert the value of the account hash)`
1. Create the magic header and the host header at the CDN: `x-cdn-access: (Insert the value of $CDN_ACCESS_KEY here)|Host: (insert URL to app container)`

## In case of emergency

If you need to deploy a codeorigin container immediately, or if there are origin pull failures and you're not sure why, deploy without setting the `CDN_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable. The codeorigin server will respond to all requests without redirecting non-origin pulls to the CDN, so this should be only used in case of emergencies.

## Build the releases sites

To build and deploy your changes for previewing in a [`jquery-wp-content`](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content) instance, follow the [workflow instructions](http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow) from our documentation on [contributing to jQuery web sites](http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/).

## Add or update project release files

To add a new release or update an existing one, simply commit the new file to the `cdn` directory and merge to the `main` branch. The container will rebuild automatically.
